# Aignment 1 Interative Development : Personal Portfolio 

This Website is a personal portfolio , it mainly presents my personal life to employers. I have 3 pages in total, A mainpage , Resume page and Project page. My main page consist of my Self introductory paragraph that would allow others who come across my page to understand me a little more in general , a photo of myself that others would see who i am visually and a contact me page which allows others to contact me by sending any messages thorugh the blank spots and a submit button that was coded to be visible to others. My Resume page consist of some of my main certificates and achievements from 3 different categories, Educational history , Job Experience and External Related Certificates. Each category consist of 2 portions each. Educational History has Primary and secondary School . Job Experience consist of my Prt-Time Job and Volunteary Job that i have done before. Lastly, Extrnal Related Certificates contains of Sports Certificates and Academic Certificates. Thirdly, My Artworks consist of 2 categories also , An artwork section and a Sports section. Sports section shows photos of me in action during competition or with my teammates. Artwork section consist of the different design stuffs i have either designed before digitally or physically artefacts. 


## Design Process

This personal portfolio is mainly more suitable for emplloyers who are finding for employees that has a sports background and highly achieved in the sports world or any art designers that are intrested in the type of style i do or a physical artefact/object maker for new prototype testings or item creations. I would be suitable. The different certificates in the Resume would let them see even clearer on what i have done/achieved before, this furthers gives them a clear idea on what i do in my past lives and gives a rough direction on whether they want to consider on signing me up in a contract in their company or not. As a digital/physical designer, i would want to create objects/items that helps to boost people in thier lives or create designs and drawings that further boost peoples lives in either a physically way or a mentally way. 

### This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. ###
